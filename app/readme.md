# Medisafe App - README

## Project Overview
Medisafe is a medication management app built using React Native and Expo. It helps users track their medications and set reminders to take them at specific times throughout the day. The app features a simple and intuitive design with the ability to add, manage, and view medication schedules.

## How to Run the Project

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure that you have **Node.js** installed on your system.
- Make sure you have **Expo CLI** installed. You can install it globally by running:
  
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### Steps to Run:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd medisafe-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the app**:

   After installing the dependencies, you can start the app using Expo:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   This will open a new tab in your browser with a QR code. Scan it with the Expo Go app (available on iOS and Android) to see the app in action.

## Libraries Used

- **React Native**: A framework for building native apps using React.
- **Expo**: A framework and platform for universal React applications. It provides tools for easier app development and deployment.
- **NativeWind**: A utility-first CSS framework for React Native that allows us to use Tailwind-like classes in React Native apps, simplifying styling decisions.
- **React Navigation**: For handling navigation between different screens in the app.
- **Ionicons** and **FontAwesome**: Icon libraries used for adding various icons like notifications, settings, and more in the app's UI.
- **React Native Modal**: For handling the modal window where users can input medication details.
- **React Native Animated**: For adding animations to the sidebar and other UI elements.
- **React Native Alert**: To show alerts in case of errors or successful actions like adding medications.

## Design and Technical Decisions

### 1. **UI Design:**
   - **Minimalistic Layout**: The app was designed with simplicity in mind. The focus is on providing easy access to medication schedules without overwhelming the user.
   - **Grid Layout for Time of Day**: A grid-based layout was used to display four boxes corresponding to different times of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night). This makes it easier for users to select and view their medication schedule.
   - **Modal for Adding Medication**: The "Add Medication" functionality is implemented within a modal. This ensures the main screen remains uncluttered, and users can add medication details without navigating away from the dashboard.
   
### 2. **State Management:**
   - **React `useState` and `useEffect` Hooks**: These hooks are used for managing the appâ€™s state, including the current page, visibility of the sidebar and modal, and the medication details.
   - **Conditional Rendering**: Based on the selected time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Night), the app conditionally renders icons and text, making the UI interactive.

### 3. **Styling Decisions:**
   - **NativeWind for Styling**: To make styling more efficient, NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) was used. This utility-first CSS framework simplifies layout, spacing, and color management without writing extensive styles.
   - **Sidebar Animation**: The sidebar is implemented using the React Native Animated API, allowing for smooth transitions when it opens or closes.

### 4. **Navigation:**
   - The app's structure relies on **React Navigation** to manage different screens. The user can navigate through the dashboard, pill management, and reports sections easily.
   - Although we haven't added full screen-based navigation in this version, it can be expanded to include additional screens and tabs in the future.

### 5. **Error Handling:**
   - Simple form validation is used when adding medications. If the user tries to add a medication without completing all fields, an alert prompts them to fill out the missing details.

## Future Enhancements
- **Push Notifications**: Implement push notifications to remind users to take their medications at the scheduled times.
- **Database Integration**: Connect the app to a database (e.g., Firebase or SQLite) to store users' medication data persistently.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication so that each user can have their personalized medication schedule.
